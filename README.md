1. System requirements and package versions can be found in the titled text file
2. Cat breeds data can be downloaded from kaggle- the shell link is in the python notebook
The notebook was written for as machine learning class project with the below scope:
      1. Problem Statement
      2. Assumptions/Hypotheses about data and model
      3. Exploratory Data Analysis
      4. Feature Engineering & Transformations
      5. Proposed Approaches (Model) with checks for overfitting/underfitting
      6. Proposed Solution (Model Selection) with regularization, if needed
      7. Results (Accuracy) and Learnings from the methodology
      8. Future Work
